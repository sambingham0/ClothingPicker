# Clothes Picker - Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

This is a *work in progress* standalone clothes picking assistant built for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. The goal is to create a personal styling tool that displays clothing options (layer, top, bottom) and allows browsing, filtering, and saving favorite outfits. The system launches automatically on boot and is designed with a minimal, icon-friendly UI for intuitive use.
